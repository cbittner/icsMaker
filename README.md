# icsMaker

Jupyter noteboook for creating an ics file with events from date strings. All events get the same title, url, description, duration and the status "tentative". The ics can be imported in tools like thunderbird/outlook. I needed it for scheduling meetings (creating numerous tentative event placeholders in my calendar) because, strangely, doodle, dfn scheduler etc. don't export ics files like this.
